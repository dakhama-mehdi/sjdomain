* The domain will be automatically choose, and use current user domain
* New option (OU/path/Reuse)
* Automaticaly add computer from destination like localcomputername with deploying tools like MDT/SCCM/WDS

# How tu use :

This work on two phases :

# First phase : create a computer account in Active Directory from list or name and chose option 
Exemple : 

* this sample comand will provision a computer account named PC-1 on AD in default OU "Computer" and save file in local folder named "Approv"

sjdomain.exe "PC-1"  

another possible option : 

-path  : Specific destination to save provisioning data file
-OU    : Specifies the name of the organizational unit (OU) in which you want the computer account to be created
-Reuse : Specifies the reuse of any existing computer account. The password for the computer account will be reset

you can custom option by using "-" or respect order example :

* this two command create a account computer on specific OU and save the file in directory c:\folder
sjdomain.exe "pc-1" c:\folder\ "ou=test,DC=info,DC=prive"  

sjdomain.exe "pc-1" -Ou "ou=test,DC=info,DC=prive"  -Path c:\folder\  

* you can create more computer separated by ","
sjdomain.exe "PC-1,PC-2,PC-3"

* create computer from list : 
sjdomain.exe c:\myfile-namecomputer.txt

# Last phase : Add computer 
To request an offline domain join for a local computer run the following command at an elevated command prompt:

* enter simply the patch to file, the computer will be restart and rename
sjdomain "c:\path-to-file\file-1"

* this command will chose from folder the file like current computer name, and add it to domain, for example if local machine named "PC-1", the tool will search the file named 
"PC-1" from folder

sjdomain.exe add "C:\folder-contains-offline-file"
